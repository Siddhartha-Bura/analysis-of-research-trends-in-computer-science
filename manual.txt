First things first, make sure you download the following input files,
https://originalstatic.aminer.cn/misc/dblp.v13.7z,
https://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/dblp.xml.gz,
https://www.kaggle.com/tanuprabhu/population-by-country-2020,
https://pkgstore.datahub.io/core/country-list/data_csv/data/d7c9d7cfb42cb69f4422dec222dbbaa8/data_csv.csv.

Extract the above input files (if extractable) and place in the same directory of the ipynb files wherever requried.

Place the dblpv13.json file that you get after extraction in  "/Analysis_Association_Correlation_Prediction/" folder if you want to execute 
association, analysis of dblp, correlation, prediction. And first run the preprocessing1.ipynb and then preprocessing2.ipynb first to obtain the dblp.txt and data.txt files. 
After that, you may execute the ipynb files in "/Analysis_Association_Correlation_Prediction/" folder

Since, the files sizes are huge, we haven't placed the input files in the project.
Moreover, output files which are text is saved in the same folder of the notebook.

* Python notebooks in this project may take longer than expected(may take few hours 1-10) and also consume lots of memory, We request you to atleast use 
  i5 processor with RAM greater than 8 Gigs in order to have a smoother experience. It is recommended to have 16 Gigs if you are multitasking while
  running the notebooks. For running the fpgrowth.ipynb, the recommended amount of RAM is 16GB. 
 
* Re-run the entire notebook incase if you ran into memory issues. And kindly do not trigger more than one notebook at a time.

* Since the notebooks take much longer to execute, there is not any top level script included to execute all the notebooks at once.
  
* Some of the outputs which are plots or graphs, to observe them, you need to get from the notebook cells itself.
