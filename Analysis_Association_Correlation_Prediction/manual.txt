The packages needed to run this project are:
1) numpy
2) matplotlib
3) seaborn
4) pandas
5) networkx
5) wordcloud

Datasets required:
	Download the dblpv13 data using this url:  "https://originalstatic.aminer.cn/misc/dblp.v13.7z" 
After downloading it, extract it to get the dblpv13.json file. It is a 16GB JSON file. 

Data Preprocessing:
 In order to preprocess the data, first execute the preprocess1.ipynb. After executing this, you will get dblp.txt file as output. 
 Next, execute the preprocess2.ipynb. After executing this, you will get data.txt as output. 

Correlation:
 In order to find the correlations, navigate into correlation folder and 
 execute the correlation.ipynb file. Then, the output files that will be generated will be 
 1) Authors Correlation Matrix.png
 2) authors_correlation.csv
 3) title_words_correlation.csv
 4) Title Words COrrelation Matrix.png


Co_Author Prediction:
 In order to predict the co-authors, navigate into co_author_prediction folder and 
 execute the Co-Author Prediction.ipynb file. Then, the output files that will be generated will be
 1) jacard_predictions.csv
 2) aac_predictions.csv

Association Rules:
 In order to obtain the association rules, navigate into association_rules folder and 
 execute the fpgrowth.ipynb file. Then, the output file that is generated will be 
 1) association_rules.csv

Analysis of DBLP data:
 In order to analyse the DBLP data, navigate into association_rules folder and 
 execute the analysis.dblp file. Then, the ouput files that will be generated will be
 1) author_years.png
 2) authors_wordcloud.png
 3) titlewords_wordcloud.png
 4) words_years.png
 5) authors_years.csv
 6) words_years.csv
